 This is the 5th Project of my Training in Python with Treehouse

 The application lets the user add or edit project information. When adding or editing a project, the application prompts the user for title, date, skills, description, and a link to a repo. 
 The results for these entries are stored in a database and displayed on the homepage. The HTML/CSS files has been provided by Treehouse. 

 For This project I will be creating a web application linking and rendering HTML files using the Flask framework. The application will create a model to add elements to the database, edit and delete them with SQLAlchemy. I also will personalise the HTML and CSS to look a bit more like me!

To run the project locally (instructions for mac): 
    1. Create a virtual environment: 
        python3 -m venv .venv
    2. Activate the virtual environment: 
        source .venv/bin/activate
    3. Instal Flask: 
        python3 -m pip install flask
